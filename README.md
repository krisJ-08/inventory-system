Create an Inventory Management System that helps the business manage their items, its movement, stock purchases and disposal. The system should have the basic features of a warehouse management system. These are the following:
1.	Users should be able to enter items, categories, measurements, and other records that can be used in inventory management.
2.	Users should be able to log movements of items, whether external movements or internal movements like deliveries, storage movements, stock transfers, declaration of defective items and the likes.
3.	Users should be able to do other related transactions that will help the users monitor their items like physical count.
4.	The system should maintain ledger entries for its items for easy monitoring.
5.	Users should be able to see inventory reports like Item Quantity, Defective Items, Item Ledger, and the likes.
